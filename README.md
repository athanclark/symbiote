# symbiote

This project aims to be a network agnostic and data format agnostic serialization verifier - it's main
purpose is to verify that _data_, _operations_ on that data, and _serialization_ of that data is
all consistent for multiple platforms. This project defines a trivial protocol that can be re-implemented
in any platform, over any network medium.

For an example, check out the tests.
